## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the
   layer when doing a build.
2. Increase the version numbers in package and the SECURITY.md to the new
   version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use
   is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other
   developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the
   second reviewer to merge it for you.
